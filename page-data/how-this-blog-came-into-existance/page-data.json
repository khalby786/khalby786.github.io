I tried would writing new posts on my Mom's mobile phone, but the project didn't even load! I was forced to search for an alternative. The thing was that I wanted to create one with pure code and not with blogging softwares such as WordPress. I tried Ghost blogs but they weren't great. Finally, while reading through the Glitch Blog, I found this really simple blog which was ready to be remixed. I wasted no time in remixing it and started to customize it however I liked. I had a lot of trouble writing this post, because my logs are filled with some errors regarding the date format of the post being not UTC and there might be chances that the date would show the time as 00:00 in the midnight.
